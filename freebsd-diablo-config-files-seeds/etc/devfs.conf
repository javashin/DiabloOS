# These are examples of how to configure devices using /etc/rc.d/devfs.
# The first parameter is always the action to take, the second is always the
# existing device created by devfs, and the last is what you want to change.
# The name of the action is only significant to the first unique character.
#
# Examples:

# Commonly used by many ports
#link	cd0	cdrom
#link	cd0	dvd

# Allow a user in the wheel group to query the smb0 device
#perm	smb0	0660

# Allow members of group operator to cat things to the speaker
#own	speaker	root:operator
#perm	speaker	0660
perm	devstat	0444




    # Allow all users to access optical media
perm    /dev/acd0       0666
perm    /dev/acd1       0666
perm    /dev/cd0        0666
perm    /dev/cd1        0666
     
    # Allow all USB Devices to be mounted
perm    /dev/da0        0666
perm    /dev/da1        0666
perm    /dev/da2        0666
