Flask-Marshmallow is a thin integration layer for Flask (a Python web framework)
and marshmallow (an object serialization/deserialization library) that adds
additional features to marshmallow, including URL and Hyperlinks fields for
HATEOAS-ready APIs. It also (optionally) integrates with Flask-SQLAlchemy.
