create the script:
%%OSSEC_HOME%%/active-response/bin/firewall-drop.sh

You can copy or hard link (symbolic link is not supported) one of the scripts
already provided by OSSEC:
%%OSSEC_HOME%%/active-response/bin/ipfilter.sh
%%OSSEC_HOME%%/active-response/bin/ipfw.sh
%%OSSEC_HOME%%/active-response/bin/pf.sh
