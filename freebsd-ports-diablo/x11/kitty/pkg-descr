A terminal emulator that uses OpenGL for offloading rendering to the GPU
and threaded rendering to minimize input latency.

- Supports all modern terminal features, tiling multiple terminal windows.
- Can be controlled from scripts or the shell prompt, even over SSH.
- Has a framework for kittens, small terminal programs that can be used to
extend kittyâ€™s functionality. For example, Unicode input and URL hints.
- Supports startup sessions which allow you to specify the window/tab
layout, working directories and programs to run on startup.
- Allows you to open the scrollback buffer in a separate window using
arbitrary programs of your choice. This is useful for browsing the
history comfortably in a pager or editor.
