  message: <<EOM
6cord was successfully installed.

Example configuration:
======================

If you want a persistent login, copy the configuration file to your home directory:

mkdir -p ~/.config/6cord # Create the config directory if non-existent
cp %%EXAMPLESDIR%%/6cord.toml ~/.config/6cord

From there, you can make adjustments to the 6cord.toml configuration file.
It's suggested you replace the token value, rather than use your Discord email
and plain-text password. You will no longer need to provide the '-t' (token), 'u' 
(username) or '-p' (password) flag when starting 6cord, depending on the values
you provided in the configuration.

Alternatively, you can use the GNOME keyring (if applicable to you) and the token
will be stored securely. This can be used by running 6cord without any arguments.

For more information, read the full help-page by running:

6cord -t
