CMake Error at /usr/local/share/cmake/Modules/FindBoost.cmake:2049 (message):
  Unable to find the requested Boost libraries.

  Boost version: 1.69.0

  Boost include path: /usr/local/include

  Could not find the following Boost libraries:

          boost_signals

  Some (but not all) of the required Boost libraries were found.  You may
  need to install these additional Boost libraries.  Alternatively, set
  BOOST_LIBRARYDIR to the directory containing Boost libraries or BOOST_ROOT
  to the location of Boost.
