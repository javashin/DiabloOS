The nsysctl utility is a sysctl(8) clone to get or set the
kernel state with libxo, libsysctlmibinfo and a lot of options.
Improvements:

 * sysctlmibinfo(3) provides a simple API to the sysctl MIB,
 * output via libxo(3) in human and machine readable formats,
 * isolated code to manage "opaque values",
 * some string value is splitted to show structured output,
 * output is explicitly indicated by the options,
 * the options are not mutually exclusive,
 * new options to show the properties of a state.
