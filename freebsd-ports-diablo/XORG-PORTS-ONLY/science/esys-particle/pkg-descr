ESyS-Particle is Open Source Software for particle-based numerical modelling
using the Discrete Element Method (DEM); a widely adapted technique for
modelling processes involving large deformations, granular flow and/or
fragmentation. ESyS-Particle is best suited for execution on parallel
supercomputers, clusters or multi-core PCs running a Linux-based operating
system. The C++ DEM simulation engine implements spatial domain decomposition
via the Message Passing Interface (MPI).
