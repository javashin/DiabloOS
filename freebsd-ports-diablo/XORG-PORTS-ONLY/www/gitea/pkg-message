When upgrading to Gitea 1.8, Gitea requires the addition of another secret
to the config file in order to start up.  Either manually add JWT_SECRET to
the ${PREFIX}/etc/gitea/conf/app.ini config file (see app.ini.sample), or
allow Gitea to make the change for you by making the config file writable to
the git user.
