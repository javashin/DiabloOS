You need data files from Heroes of Might and Magic III. You can find them in
any of the following:
* one or two CD's or CD images
* gog.com installer
* directory with installed game

Run the script using options appropriate to your input files:

vcmibuilder --cd1 /path/to/iso/or/cd --cd2 /path/to/second/cd
vcmibuilder --gog /path/to/gog.com/installer
vcmibuilder --data /path/to/h3/data

You should use only one of these commands.
