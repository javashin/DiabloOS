  message: <<EOM
If games/anki was installed from the official FreeBSD package repository, an
additional step is required to complete the installation.

This is because the audio/lame port, which is also required by Anki, cannot be
provided as a package due to an unclear legal situation about its distribution
in binary form.

To finish the installation, install audio/lame from either ports or a local
package repository and set it afterwards as automatic via "pkg set -A1 lame".
