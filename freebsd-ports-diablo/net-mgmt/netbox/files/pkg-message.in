Please note that NetBox requires a PostgreSQL database server, which uses its
built-in network address datatypes. Thus NetBox won't work with other RDBMS's,
e.g. MySQL, MariaDB, etc.

For installation instructions please refer to the related wiki page:

{ type: upgrade
  message: <<EOD
As always it is strongly encouraged to make a backup of the database before the
database migrations will be executed.

The following steps are required to finish the upgrade: 

1. Run database migrations and collect static files:

# cd %%DATADIR%%
# python%%PYTHON_VER%% manage.py migrate
# python%%PYTHON_VER%% manage.py collectstatic --no-input

2. Restart WSGI/httpd environment (supervisord/apache/nginx/etc.)

1. New dependency: Redis

Since the 2.6 release a running Redis server instance is required for caching
objects to run. Also the following settings like below need to be added (or
modified) in the existing configuration.py:

REDIS = {
	'HOST': 'localhost',
	'PORT': 6397,
	'PASSWORD': ''
	'DATABASE': 0,
	'CACHE_DATABASE': 1,
	'DEFAULT_TIMEOUT': 300,
	'SSL': False,
}

Note that if you were using these settings in a prior release with webhooks,
the DATABASE setting remains the same but an additional CACHE_DATABASE settings
has been added with a default value of 1 to support the caching backend.

The DATABASE setting will be renamed in a future release of NetBox to better
relay the meaning of the setting. It is highly recommended to keep the webhook
and cache databases separate. Using the same database number for both may
result in webhook processing data being lost during cache flushing events.


2. View Permissions

NetBox now enforces view-only permissions by default. You can grant view
permission to a user or group by assigning the "can view" permission for the
desired objects.

To exclude _all_ objects, effectively disabling view permissions and restoring
the pre-v2.6 behavior, set:

EXEMPT_VIEW_PERMISSIONS = ['*']


3. CORS_ORIGIN_WHITELIST requires URI Scheme

If you have the CORS_ORIGIN_WHITELIST configuration parameter defined, note
that each origin must now include a URI scheme.
