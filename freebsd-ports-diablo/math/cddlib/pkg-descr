Cddlib is a C library that implements the Double Description Method
of Motzkin et al. for generating all vertices (i.e. extreme points)
and extreme rays of a general convex polyhedron given by a system of
linear inequalities in any finite dimensional real coordinate space.

The program can be used for the reverse operation (i.e. convex hull
computation). This means that one can move back and forth between an
inequality representation and a generator (i.e. vertex and ray) 
representation of a polyhedron with cddlib. Also, cddlib can solve a
linear programming problem, i.e. a problem of maximizing and
minimizing a linear function over P.
