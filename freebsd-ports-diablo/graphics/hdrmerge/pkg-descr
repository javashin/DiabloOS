HDRMerge combines two or more raw images into a single raw with an
extended dynamic range. It can import any raw image supported by LibRaw,
and outputs a DNG 1.4 image with floating point data. The output raw is
built from the less noisy pixels of the input, so that shadows maintain
as much detail as possible. This tool also offers a GUI to remove
‘ghosts’ from the resulting image.
